# Federated Learning for Pandemics

This repo is created for beta-testing the Manning liveProject *Federated Learning Over Networks for Pandemics* series by Alex Jung. Since this will not be a free project, the data used for the analysis will not be available through this repo.

As of August 16, 2021, the liveProject is not available to the public yet. The contents of the final version will likely be different from the version I did.

## About the contents

The liveProject series comprises three projects, which each has a separate directory in `codes`.

1. `1-handling-sensitive-data` contains the notebooks submitted for the first liveProject *Handling sensitive Data*. This covers the basics of `numpy` and `pandas`.
2. `2-build-network-models` contains the notebooks submitted for the first liveProject *Build Network Models for Pandemics*. This covers the basics of `NetworkX` and updating the federated model weights.
3. `3-personalized-diagnosis` contains the notebooks submitted for the first liveProject *Personalized Diagnosis of Symptoms*. It is the main part, where I use `NetworkX` to build a federated logistic regression model out of synthetic data to predict whether a person has been infected.
